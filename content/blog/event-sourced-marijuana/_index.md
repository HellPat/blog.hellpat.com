No thanks. Event-sourcing is about telling stories — the complete, unvarnished history of *how* things happened. CRUD gives you a snapshot; event-sourcing gives you the narrative.

This series uses marijuana cultivation to explore event-sourcing because, like any living system, plants don't just *exist* in a state — they *become* that state through a series of events. Water them consistently, they thrive. Neglect them, they die. The events tell the story that a database row never could.

If you're tired of contrived examples that don't capture why event-sourcing matters, let's grow something real.
